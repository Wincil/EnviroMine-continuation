## EnviroMine continuation
#### based on [EnviroMine for Galaxy Odyssey](https://gitgud.io/AstroTibs/enviromine-for-galaxy-odyssey) by [AstroTibs](https://gitgud.io/AstroTibs)

## REQUIRES [UNIMIXINS](https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins/releases)

## IMPORTANT:
**For most things in this mod to work correctly, do the following: `Enviromine menu - Custom Editor - Profile settings - default_settings.cfg - Config - Generate Defaults - true`**

**Please note, this is a very long process! may take up to 30 minutes of real time if you are using a large modpack**


## Physics for blocks is disabled by default!
**To use it, go to: `Enviromine menu -> Custom editor -> Profile settings -> default_settings.cfg -> general -> Enable Physics -> true`,**
